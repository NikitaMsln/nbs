# Encryption at rest (NRD/Mirrored)

## General information
The data encryption key (DEK) is stored in encrypted form in the volume metadata ([EncryptionDesc](../../../contrib/ydb/core/protos/blockstore_config.proto#L117)). For DEKs generating and encrypting the root key management service (RootKMS) is used. A master key that uses for encryption and decryption of DEKs is stored in RootKMS and is not transmitted in open form - requests to RootKMS use only the identificator of the master key. If the master key is compromised, a new one is generated and then all DEKs must be re-encrypted (and updated in the volume metadata) using the new master key.

## Creating a volume
NBS requests a new DEK from RootKMS, sending the master key identificator. The received encrypted DEK is stored in the volume metadata.

    NBS->>+RootKMS: generate DEK (master key id)
    RootKMS-->>-NBS: encrypted DEK
    NBS->>NBS: store DEK in VolumeConfig
```

## Mounting a volume
NBS requests a decrypted DEK from RootKMS, sending the encrypted DEK and the master key. The received DEK is used for the encryption/decryption of IO requests data. To handle IO requests the [TEncryptionClient](../../../cloud/blockstore/libs/encryption/encryption_client.cpp#L138) is used.

    participant RootKMS

    NBS->>NBS: get encrypted DEK from VolumeConfig
    NBS->>+RootKMS: decrypt DEK (master key id, encrypted DEK)
    RootKMS-->>-NBS: DEK
    NBS->>NBS: create TEncryptionClient (DEK)
```
